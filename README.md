## Predicting Forest Covers

### Description
The goal of the project is to predict the type of forest cover, a categorical variable, using a variety of information related to a specific geographical area...

### Models Explored
Our approach included experimenting with several classifiers, each with its unique strengths and trade-offs, to determine which models provide the highest accuracy in predicting the forest cover types, including
- Extra Trees Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- CatBoost
- Decision Tree Classifier



### Results
Our best model was an Extra Trees Classifier, which produced a validation score of 0.89 and a test score of 0.80.
